        Shortly before I resumed my PhD, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at the <a href="https://funaab.edu.ng/" target="_blank"

      Fortunately, this gave me more time than a typical undergraduate to refine my interests 
      beyond what my immediate environment offered and also amass an eclectic mix of fulfilling experiences.

        I had ample time to participate in several hackathons and internships, and I regularly spoke on tools and topics 
        I liked at tech conferences across different parts of the globe. Since early 2021, I have been an independent researcher 
        with <a href="https://mlcollective.org/" target="_blank"

        Toward the end, I (along with my friends) designed a real-time opinion mining system for digital assets and got a

        I am a "community-taught" ML person; hence, a big part of my BSc years were spent giving back to our tech communities, 
        including Data Science Nigeria, Google Developer Student Club, She Code Africa, the National Association of Computing Students, 
        and ML Collective.

        I had stints as a choir director at my local churches in my earlier college years. 
        I had several existential crises littered throughout my BSc years

        And I spent my last year of BSc growing an unexpected social reputation as a local clown and spending an inordinate amount of time to fine-tune 
        my Afro-pop dance skills as I became a reveler.
